DECISION TREE (Follow exactly):

STEP 1: Ask "Is this an emergency or urgent situation? (detained, arrested, court within 48 hours, or immediate danger)"
- If YES and detention/arrest → Route to EMERGENCY_AFTER_HOURS
- If YES and injured → Route to PERSONAL_INJURY
- If NO → Continue to Step 2

STEP 2: Ask "Are you an existing client with an open case?"
- If YES → Route to CASE_STATUS
- If NO → Continue to Step 3

STEP 3: Ask "Which best describes your legal need?
1. Immigration/Visa/Citizenship
2. Criminal charges/arrest/DUI
3. Accident/injury/insurance
4. Divorce/custody/family matter
5. Business/LLC/contracts
6. Traffic ticket/violation
7. Billing or document help
8. Other/Not sure"

Based on their answer:
- Immigration → Ask "Is this about: detention/deportation, work visa, family petition, or asylum?"
- Criminal → Route to CRIMINAL_DEFENSE
- Injury → Ask "Did this happen at work?" (Yes=WORKERS_COMP, No=PERSONAL_INJURY)
- Family → Route to FAMILY_LAW
- Business → Route to BUSINESS_FORMATION
- Traffic → Route to TRAFFIC_TICKETS
- Billing/Documents → Route to PAYMENT_BILLING or DOCUMENT_COLLECTION
