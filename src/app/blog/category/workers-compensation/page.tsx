        <h2>Workers' Compensation Law: Protecting Injured Workers</h2>
        
        <p>When you're injured on the job, workers' compensation insurance should provide the medical care and wage replacement you need to recover. However, the reality is that many injured workers face denied claims, delayed benefits, and inadequate compensation. At Vasquez Law Firm, we fight to ensure injured workers receive the full benefits they deserve under the law.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Workers' Compensation</h3>
        
        <p>Workers' compensation is a no-fault insurance system designed to provide benefits to employees injured in the course of their employment. In exchange for these guaranteed benefits, employees generally cannot sue their employers for workplace injuries.</p>

        <h3>Benefits Available Under Workers' Compensation</h3>
        
        <h4>Medical Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>All necessary medical treatment related to your work injury</li>
          <li>Prescription medications</li>
          <li>Physical therapy and rehabilitation</li>
          <li>Medical equipment and prosthetics</li>
          <li>Travel expenses to and from medical appointments</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Wage Replacement Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temporary Total Disability:</strong> When you cannot work at all during recovery</li>
          <li><strong>Temporary Partial Disability:</strong> When you can work but earn less due to restrictions</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent Partial Disability:</strong> Compensation for permanent impairment</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent Total Disability:</strong> For injuries preventing any future work</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Additional Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Vocational rehabilitation and job retraining</li>
          <li>Death benefits for surviving family members</li>
          <li>Funeral expenses</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Workers' Compensation Claims Are Denied</h3>
        
        <p>Insurance companies often deny legitimate claims for various reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claiming the injury didn't occur at work</li>
          <li>Alleging the injury was pre-existing</li>
          <li>Missed deadlines for reporting or filing</li>
          <li>Insufficient medical documentation</li>
          <li>Disputes about the severity of injuries</li>
          <li>Claims of employee misconduct or intoxication</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Claims Process: What to Expect</h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Report the Injury:</strong> Notify your employer immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Seek Medical Treatment:</strong> Get care from approved providers</li>
          <li><strong>File a Claim:</strong> Submit required forms within deadlines</li>
          <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Insurance company reviews your claim</li>
          <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Claim approved or denied</li>
          <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> Challenge denials through proper channels</li>
        </ol>

          <li>Other drivers (vehicle accidents)</li>
          <li>Contractors or subcontractors</li>
