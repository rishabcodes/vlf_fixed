      question: 'What are the penalties for hit and run in NC and FL?',
      answer: 'Property damage only: Misdemeanor with up to 120 days jail in NC, 60 days in FL. Injury cases: Felony with 4-25 months prison in NC, up to 5 years in FL. Fatal cases: Class D felony in NC (up to 204 months), first-degree felony in FL (up to 30 years).',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I didn\'t know I hit something?',
      answer: 'Lack of knowledge is a valid defense. If you genuinely didn\'t know you caused damage or hit someone, you can\'t be convicted. We\'ll investigate road conditions, vehicle damage, and witness accounts to prove you had no knowledge.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I turn myself in for hit and run?',
      answer: 'Contact an attorney first! While cooperation can help, anything you say can be used against you. We can arrange surrender, negotiate with prosecutors, and protect your rights while showing cooperation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I avoid jail time for hit and run?',
      answer: 'Possibly. First-time property damage cases often avoid jail through probation, restitution, and community service. Injury cases are more serious but alternatives exist. Quick action and making victim whole improves outcomes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I left because I was scared or panicked?',
      answer: 'Panic is understandable but not a legal defense. However, returning to scene quickly or reporting promptly shows good faith. Mental health issues, PTSD, or legitimate fear for safety may mitigate penalties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will hit and run affect my immigration status?',
      answer: 'Yes, hit and run can be a deportable offense or bar naturalization. Felony hit and run is an aggravated felony for immigration. Even misdemeanors cause problems. Immigration consequences must be considered in any plea.',
    },
