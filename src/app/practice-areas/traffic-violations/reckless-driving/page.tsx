  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What is considered reckless driving?',
      answer: 'Driving carelessly and heedlessly in willful or wanton disregard for safety. Common examples: speeding over 80 mph, 20+ mph over limit, weaving through traffic, racing, passing school bus, running red lights. Police have wide discretion.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the penalties for reckless driving?',
      answer: 'Class 2 misdemeanor in NC: up to 60 days jail, $1,000 fine, 4 DMV points, 4 insurance points. In FL: up to 90 days jail first offense, $500 fine, 4 points. Second offense within year: up to 6 months jail. Criminal record results.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I go to jail for reckless driving?',
      answer: 'Yes, especially for high speeds (100+ mph), accidents with injuries, or prior convictions. First-time offenders often avoid jail through plea negotiations, but judges increasingly impose jail for excessive speeds or dangerous behavior.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will reckless driving affect my insurance?',
      answer: 'Severely. Reckless driving adds 4 insurance points (80% rate increase in NC). Many insurers drop coverage entirely. Stays on record 3 years for insurance. Some companies won\'t insure you at any price.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can reckless driving be reduced?',
      answer: 'Often yes. We negotiate reductions to improper equipment, speeding, or unsafe movement - infractions instead of misdemeanors. Factors: driving record, speed, circumstances, and quick action. Never plead guilty without trying reduction.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about out-of-state reckless driving?',
      answer: 'Most states report to your home state, affecting your license and insurance. Virginia reckless driving is especially serious (Class 1 misdemeanor, 12 months jail possible). Always fight out-of-state charges.',
    },

    introduction: `Reckless driving is a criminal misdemeanor - not just a traffic ticket. Conviction means potential jail time, massive insurance increases, criminal record, and license suspension. Whether charged with excessive speed, aggressive driving, or racing, immediate aggressive defense is critical.
