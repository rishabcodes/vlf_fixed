    {
      question: 'Can I get punitive damages from a drunk driver?',
      answer: 'Yes! Drunk driving shows gross negligence qualifying for punitive damages. These damages punish the drunk driver and can significantly increase your recovery. We\'ve secured punitive awards exceeding compensatory damages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I sue the bar that served the drunk driver?',
      answer: 'Often yes. Dram shop laws hold bars, restaurants, and stores liable for serving obviously intoxicated patrons or minors who cause accidents. We investigate where the driver drank and pursue all liable parties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the drunk driver has minimal insurance?',
      answer: 'We pursue multiple sources: the driver\'s assets, dram shop claims against establishments, social host liability, your uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and criminal restitution. We maximize recovery from all available sources.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the criminal DUI case affect my civil claim?',
      answer: 'A DUI conviction helps prove liability in your civil case. We coordinate with prosecutors, obtain evidence from criminal proceedings, and use conviction as powerful evidence. Criminal restitution can supplement civil recovery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages can I recover from a drunk driver?',
      answer: 'All economic damages (medical, lost wages, property), non-economic damages (pain, suffering, emotional distress), and punitive damages. Drunk driving cases often result in higher settlements due to jury anger at impaired drivers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I wait for the criminal case to finish?',
      answer: 'No! Evidence disappears, witnesses forget, and statutes of limitations run. We can proceed with civil claims while criminal case pending. Early action often produces better results and preserves all options.',
    },
