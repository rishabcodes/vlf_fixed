      question: 'Do I need to wear a helmet when cycling in North Carolina?',
      answer:
        "NC law only requires helmets for riders under 16. However, not wearing a helmet doesn't automatically bar your personal injury claim if a driver's negligence caused your accident. We can still recover full compensation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is North Carolina's contributory negligence law for bicycle accidents?",
      answer:
        "NC follows pure contributory negligence, meaning if you're found even 1% at fault, you recover nothing. Insurance companies exploit this harsh law, but we know how to prove the driver was 100% at fault.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I recover compensation if I wasn't in a bike lane when hit?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Cyclists aren't required to use bike lanes in NC. You have the right to use the full travel lane when necessary for safety. We'll prove you were riding legally and the driver failed to share the road.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the 4-foot passing law in North Carolina?',
      answer:
        'NC law requires drivers to maintain at least 4 feet of clearance when passing cyclists. Violations of this law are strong evidence of driver negligence and can support your injury claim.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much compensation can I receive for my bicycle accident injuries?',
      answer:
        "Compensation varies based on injury severity, medical costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering. We've recovered millions for cyclists, including cases exceeding $500,000 for severe injuries.",
