      question: 'What must I prove in a product liability case?',
      answer: 'You must show: (1) the product was defective, (2) the defect existed when it left manufacturer\'s control, (3) you used it as intended or reasonably foreseeable, and (4) the defect caused your injuries. We handle the complex proof required.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who can be held liable for defective products?',
      answer: 'Any party in the distribution chain: manufacturers, component makers, assemblers, wholesalers, and retailers. We pursue all liable parties to maximize your recovery. Strict liability often applies - no need to prove negligence.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I threw away the defective product?',
      answer: 'Don\'t worry. We can often prove defects through other evidence: similar incidents, recalls, expert analysis, your injuries, photos, and witness testimony. However, always preserve the product if possible.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a product liability claim?',
      answer: 'Generally 3 years from injury in North Carolina, 4 years in Florida. But there\'s also a "statute of repose" - NC has 12 years from initial purchase, FL has 12 years from delivery. Some exceptions apply. Act quickly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I modified the product or misused it?',
      answer: 'Reasonable modifications or foreseeable misuse may not bar recovery. Products must be safe for reasonably anticipated uses. Comparative fault may reduce but not eliminate compensation. We analyze all defenses.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages can I recover in product liability?',
      answer: 'Medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, emotional distress, and sometimes punitive damages for egregious conduct. Wrongful death cases include family losses. We pursue maximum compensation.',
    },
