      question: 'Do pedestrians always have the right of way?',
      answer: 'Not always, but drivers must exercise extreme care around pedestrians. Pedestrians have right of way in crosswalks, but must also follow traffic signals. Even if pedestrian violated rules, drivers must try to avoid hitting them. We fight contributory negligence defenses.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I was hit outside a crosswalk?',
      answer: 'You may still have a case! Drivers must watch for pedestrians everywhere. Jaywalking doesn\'t eliminate driver responsibility, especially if they were speeding, distracted, or impaired. Many "unmarked crosswalks" exist at intersections.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How serious are pedestrian accident injuries?',
      answer: 'Extremely serious. Without vehicle protection, pedestrians suffer traumatic brain injuries, spinal damage, fractures, internal injuries, and death. Average hospital stay exceeds 10 days. Many victims never fully recover. Compensation must reflect lifetime impacts.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What compensation can pedestrians receive?',
      answer: 'Medical expenses (emergency, surgery, rehabilitation), lost wages, future earnings, pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment, and sometimes punitive damages. Fatal cases include funeral costs and family losses. We pursue maximum recovery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the driver fled the scene?',
      answer: 'Hit-and-run is common in pedestrian accidents. We investigate aggressively: canvas for witnesses, obtain surveillance video, check nearby damage reports, coordinate with police. Uninsured motorist coverage may apply. Crime victim funds available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a claim?',
      answer: 'Generally 3 years for injury in North Carolina and 4 years in Florida, but evidence disappears quickly. Surveillance video gets overwritten, witnesses forget, skid marks fade. Contact us immediately to preserve crucial evidence.',

    introduction: `Pedestrian accidents are among the most devastating collisions, with walkers facing multi-ton vehicles without protection. A simple walk to the store, jog through the neighborhood, or crossing to your car can become life-changing tragedy. Drivers who fail to watch for pedestrians - whether distracted, speeding, or impaired - must be held accountable for the catastrophic injuries they cause.`,
