      question: 'Can I sue if hit by a police car or ambulance?',
      answer: 'Yes, but it\'s complex. Emergency vehicles have limited immunity when responding to emergencies with lights/sirens. However, they\'re liable for gross negligence, reckless driving, or accidents during non-emergency situations. We navigate immunity laws to hold them accountable.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the emergency vehicle had lights and sirens on?',
      answer: 'Even with lights/sirens, emergency vehicles must drive with due regard for safety. They can\'t blindly speed through intersections or drive recklessly. If they showed reckless disregard for public safety, they\'re liable despite emergency status.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a claim against a government vehicle?',
      answer: 'Much shorter than regular claims! In NC, you must file notice within 90 days for local government and 3 years for state. In FL, notice is required within 3 years but earlier is better. Missing deadlines bars your claim forever.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages can I recover from emergency vehicle accidents?',
      answer: 'Same as other accidents: medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, property damage. However, some states cap government liability. We maximize recovery within legal limits and explore all liable parties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I was a patient in the ambulance during the crash?',
      answer: 'You have strong claims! As a patient, the ambulance company owes you the highest duty of care. You can claim for crash injuries plus any worsening of your original medical condition. Private ambulance companies have full liability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do different rules apply to volunteer firefighters?',
      answer: 'Yes, volunteer departments may have different immunity and insurance coverage. Some are covered by municipalities, others by separate entities. We investigate all coverage sources to maximize your recovery.',
    },
