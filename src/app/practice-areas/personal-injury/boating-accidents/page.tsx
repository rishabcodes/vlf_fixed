      question: 'Who is liable in a boating accident?',
      answer: 'Liability can fall on boat operators, boat owners, rental companies, marinas, manufacturers, or other boaters. Common causes include operator negligence, BUI, equipment failure, and violations of navigation rules. We investigate all potential defendants.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the boat operator was drunk?',
      answer: 'Boating Under the Influence (BUI) is illegal with BAC of .08% or higher. Drunk boating cases often result in enhanced damages and punitive awards. Criminal charges strengthen civil claims. We coordinate with prosecutors for maximum recovery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does boat insurance cover accidents?',
      answer: 'Most boat policies cover liability and property damage, but coverage varies widely. Many boaters are underinsured. We pursue all available insurance, including homeowners umbrella policies and marina liability coverage.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are common boating accident injuries?',
      answer: 'Drowning and near-drowning, traumatic brain injuries from impacts, propeller lacerations, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia, spinal injuries, and wrongful death. Water accidents often cause severe, life-changing injuries.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a boating accident claim?',
      answer: 'Generally 3 years in North Carolina for personal injury. However, maritime law may apply different deadlines. If the accident involved government vessels or occurred in federal waters, shorter notice requirements may apply. Contact us immediately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I was partially at fault?',
      answer: 'North Carolina\'s contributory negligence rule can bar recovery if you\'re even 1% at fault. However, maritime law may apply comparative fault instead. We analyze jurisdiction and applicable law to maximize your recovery options.',
