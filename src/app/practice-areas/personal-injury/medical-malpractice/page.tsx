      question: 'How do I know if I have a medical malpractice case?',
      answer: 'You may have a case if: (1) A healthcare provider violated the standard of care, (2) You suffered significant harm, and (3) The negligence directly caused your injury. Medical experts must confirm the provider\'s actions fell below accepted medical standards. We provide free case evaluations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the statute of limitations for medical malpractice in North Carolina?',
      answer: 'In NC, you have 3 years from the date of injury OR 1 year from discovering the injury (but no more than 4 years total). For children under 10, the deadline extends to their 10th birthday. Florida has a 2-year limit with some exceptions. Act quickly to preserve your rights.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much is my medical malpractice case worth?',
      answer: 'Case values vary based on severity of injury, medical costs, lost wages, and pain/suffering. NC caps non-economic damages at a substantial amount that adjusts annually for inflation. We\'ve recovered millions for clients, with significant settlements for surgical errors and birth injuries across our practice areas.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need medical experts for my case?',
      answer: 'Yes, medical malpractice cases require expert testimony to prove the standard of care was breached. We work with nationally recognized medical experts in every specialty to build strong cases. Expert costs are advanced by our firm.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the doctor admits they made a mistake?',
      answer: 'Not all medical mistakes constitute malpractice. The error must represent a deviation from accepted medical standards that caused harm. However, admissions can strengthen your case. Document everything and contact us immediately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a medical malpractice case take?',
      answer: 'Most cases resolve in 18-24 months, though complex cases may take 3+ years. Timeline includes: investigation (3-6 months), filing lawsuit, discovery (12-18 months), mediation/trial. We push for quick resolution while maximizing your recovery.',
