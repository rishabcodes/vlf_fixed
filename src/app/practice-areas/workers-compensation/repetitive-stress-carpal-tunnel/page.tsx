      question: 'How do I prove a repetitive stress injury is work-related?',
      answer: 'Document your job duties, repetitive motions, and when symptoms began. Medical records linking the condition to work activities are crucial. We help establish the connection through ergonomic assessments, job analysis, and medical expert testimony.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get workers comp for carpal tunnel syndrome?',
      answer: 'Yes, if your job duties caused or significantly contributed to the condition. Common qualifying jobs include office workers, assembly line workers, cashiers, and construction workers. Medical evidence and work history documentation are essential.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if my employer says it\'s arthritis, not work-related?',
      answer: 'Employers often blame age or arthritis to deny claims. However, work can aggravate pre-existing conditions, making them compensable. Our medical experts distinguish between natural aging and work-accelerated conditions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do repetitive stress injury claims take?',
      answer: 'These claims often take longer because causation is disputed. Expect 6-12 months for resolution, though urgent medical treatment can be approved sooner. Strong medical evidence speeds up the process.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What benefits can I receive for RSI?',
      answer: 'Benefits include medical treatment, surgery if needed, physical therapy, temporary disability during recovery, permanent disability ratings, and vocational rehabilitation if you can\'t return to your job.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I report gradual onset pain to my employer?',
      answer: 'Yes, report symptoms as soon as they affect your work. Document the report in writing. Delayed reporting is a common reason for denial, even though RSI develops gradually.',
    },
