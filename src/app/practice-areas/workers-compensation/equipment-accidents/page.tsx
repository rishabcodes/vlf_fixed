      question: 'What are the most common equipment accident injuries?',
      answer: 'Crush injuries, amputations, lacerations, fractures, head trauma, and spinal injuries are most common. Equipment accidents often cause catastrophic injuries requiring extensive medical treatment, multiple surgeries, and permanent disability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is liable for equipment accidents at work?',
      answer: 'Workers comp covers most equipment injuries regardless of fault. However, you may have additional claims against equipment manufacturers (product liability), maintenance companies, or third-party contractors who created unsafe conditions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I wasn\'t properly trained on the equipment?',
      answer: 'Lack of training strengthens your case. Employers must provide adequate training under OSHA regulations. Inadequate training may support additional negligence claims and increase settlement values, especially if OSHA cites violations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I sue if defective equipment caused my injury?',
      answer: 'Yes, product liability claims against manufacturers are separate from workers comp. Defective design, manufacturing defects, or inadequate warnings can support lawsuits for full damages including pain and suffering.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What compensation is available for equipment accidents?',
      answer: 'Workers comp provides medical treatment, disability benefits, and vocational rehabilitation. Third-party claims can add pain/suffering, full lost wages, and punitive damages. Catastrophic injuries may warrant million-dollar settlements.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to report an equipment accident?',
      answer: 'Report immediately! North Carolina requires notice within 30 days (2 years to file claim). Florida requires 30-day notice (2 years to file). Immediate reporting preserves evidence and strengthens your claim.',
