    {
      question: 'How do I prove an occupational disease is work-related?',
      answer: 'You need medical evidence linking your disease to workplace exposures. This includes exposure history, medical diagnosis, expert testimony, and often epidemiological studies showing increased risk in your occupation. Industrial hygiene testing and coworker cases strengthen claims.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the time limit for occupational disease claims?',
      answer: 'Complex timing rules apply. Generally, you have 2 years from when you knew or should have known the disease was work-related. For progressive diseases like asbestosis, the clock starts when you\'re disabled or diagnosed. Don\'t delay - evidence disappears.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I file a claim years after leaving the job?',
      answer: 'Yes! Many occupational diseases have long latency periods. Asbestos-related cancers may appear 20-40 years after exposure. The key is proving exposure during employment and that the disease resulted from that exposure.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if multiple employers exposed me to hazards?',
      answer: 'All responsible employers/insurers may share liability. The last employer where injurious exposure occurred often bears primary responsibility. We identify all sources of exposure to maximize your recovery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are first responder cancers covered?',
      answer: 'Many states including Florida provide cancer presumptions for firefighters. Certain cancers are presumed work-related if you meet service requirements. North Carolina is expanding protections. We stay current on evolving laws.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What compensation is available for occupational disease?',
      answer: 'Full medical treatment, temporary disability during treatment, permanent disability ratings, death benefits for families. Some diseases like mesothelioma may also have third-party claims against manufacturers worth millions.',
    },
