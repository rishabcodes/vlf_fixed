    {
      question: 'Can I get workers comp for mental health conditions?',
      answer: 'Yes, but it\'s challenging. Mental health claims require proving the condition arose from workplace events beyond normal stress. Specific traumatic incidents, violence, or extreme conditions typically qualify. Physical-mental claims (mental health from physical injuries) are easier to prove.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What mental health conditions qualify for workers comp?',
      answer: 'PTSD, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, major depression, and anxiety disorders can qualify. The condition must result from specific workplace trauma, not general job stress. First responders have special presumptions for PTSD in many cases.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I prove a mental health workers comp claim?',
      answer: 'Documentation is crucial: incident reports, witness statements, medical records, psychiatrist diagnosis, and treatment history. You must show the workplace event was the predominant cause of your condition, not personal issues or pre-existing conditions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I had mental health issues before?',
      answer: 'Pre-existing conditions don\'t automatically disqualify you. If work trauma significantly worsened your condition or caused new symptoms, you may qualify. The work event must be the predominant cause of your current disability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do first responders get special mental health protections?',
      answer: 'Yes! North Carolina and Florida provide PTSD presumptions for first responders. If you\'re diagnosed with PTSD after qualifying events, it\'s presumed work-related. This makes claims easier for police, firefighters, and EMTs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What benefits are available for mental health claims?',
      answer: 'Same as physical injuries: medical treatment (therapy, medication), temporary disability while unable to work, permanent disability ratings, and vocational rehabilitation. Mental health treatment can be extensive and expensive - workers comp must cover it all.',
    },
