    {
      question: 'What is a third-party work injury claim?',
      answer: 'When someone other than your employer or coworker causes your workplace injury, you may have a third-party claim. This is separate from workers comp and allows recovery of full damages including pain and suffering, full lost wages, and punitive damages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I file both workers comp and a third-party lawsuit?',
      answer: 'Yes! You can receive workers comp benefits immediately while pursuing a third-party lawsuit. Workers comp provides quick medical and wage benefits, while the lawsuit seeks full compensation. The workers comp carrier may claim reimbursement from any settlement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What damages can I recover in a third-party claim?',
      answer: 'Unlike workers comp, third-party claims allow full damages: 100% of lost wages (not just 2/3), pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, punitive damages, and spouse\'s loss of consortium claims.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who can be sued in a third-party work injury case?',
      answer: 'Product manufacturers, property owners, general contractors, subcontractors, drivers who hit you, equipment manufacturers, maintenance companies, security companies, and any other party whose negligence caused your injury (except your employer/coworkers).',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a third-party claim?',
      answer: 'Personal injury lawsuits typically have a 3-year statute of limitations in North Carolina and 4 years in Florida. Product liability may be different. Don\'t wait - evidence disappears and witnesses forget. Contact us immediately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does workers comp liens work with third-party settlements?',
      answer: 'Workers comp insurers have subrogation rights to recover what they paid from your third-party settlement. However, we negotiate reductions, ensure credit for attorney fees, and maximize what you keep. Never settle without addressing the lien.',
    },

But when a third party causes your workplace injury, you can pursue full compensation through a separate lawsuit. Our attorneys identify all liable parties, coordinate with your workers comp claim, and fight for maximum recovery including pain and suffering damages not available through workers comp alone.`,
