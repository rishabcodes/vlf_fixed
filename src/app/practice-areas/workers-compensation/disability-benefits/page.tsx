      question: 'How much are disability benefits in workers comp?',
      answer: 'In North Carolina and Florida, temporary total disability pays approximately two-thirds of your average weekly wage, subject to state maximums. Current maximums are set annually by each state. Permanent disability varies based on impairment rating and body part affected.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long can I receive temporary disability benefits?',
      answer: 'TTD continues until you reach Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) or return to work. NC limits are 500 weeks for most injuries, 400 weeks for back injuries. Florida limits are 104 weeks (2 years) unless you\'re deemed catastrophically injured.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)?',
      answer: 'MMI means your condition has stabilized and further improvement is unlikely. At MMI, temporary benefits end and permanent disability evaluation begins. You can challenge premature MMI determinations with second medical opinions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work while receiving disability benefits?',
      answer: 'Yes, with restrictions. Light duty or part-time work may qualify for TPD benefits covering wage differences. Report all earnings to avoid benefit suspension. We help structure work attempts to protect your benefits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How are permanent disability ratings calculated?',
      answer: 'Doctors assign impairment ratings using AMA Guides. Ratings translate to weeks of compensation based on body part. Back injuries in NC: 300 weeks √ó rating percentage √ó comp rate. We ensure accurate ratings and maximum compensation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I accept a lump sum settlement?',
      answer: 'Settlements provide immediate funds but end future benefits. Consider future medical needs, disability progression, and Medicare requirements. Never accept settlements without legal review - initial offers are typically significantly below fair value.',
