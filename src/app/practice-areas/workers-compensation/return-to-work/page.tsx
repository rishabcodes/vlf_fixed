      question: 'Can my employer force me back to work before I\'m ready?',

    },
    {
      question: 'What if the light duty job is degrading or fake?',
      answer: 'Employers sometimes create meaningless jobs to cut benefits. If light duty is substantially different from any real position, unsafe, or designed to humiliate you into quitting, we can challenge it and protect your benefits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I refuse light duty work?',
      answer: 'Be careful - refusing suitable light duty can stop your benefits. However, you can refuse if: work exceeds medical restrictions, travel is unreasonable, or the job is clearly unsuitable. Always consult us before refusing.',

      question: 'What if I try to return but can\'t do the work?',

    {
      question: 'Can I be fired while on workers comp?',
      answer: 'Employers cannot fire you for filing workers comp, but may terminate for legitimate business reasons. If fired shortly after injury or claim, it may be illegal retaliation. We investigate terminations and fight back.',
    },

      question: 'What if I can never return to my old job?',
