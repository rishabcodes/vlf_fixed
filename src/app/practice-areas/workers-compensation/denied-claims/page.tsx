      question: 'Why was my workers compensation claim denied?',
      answer: 'Common denial reasons include: late reporting, disputes about whether injury occurred at work, pre-existing conditions, lack of medical evidence, or missed deadlines. Insurance companies often deny valid claims hoping workers won\'t appeal. We review denials and build strong appeals.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to appeal a denied claim?',
      answer: 'In North Carolina, you typically have 2 years from denial to request a hearing. In Florida, you have 30 days to file a Petition for Benefits. Acting quickly preserves evidence and witness testimony. Contact us immediately after any denial.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I be fired for filing a workers comp claim?',
      answer: 'No, retaliation for filing workers comp is illegal. Employers cannot fire, demote, or discriminate against you for pursuing benefits. If retaliation occurs, you may have additional claims for wrongful termination and damages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the insurance company\'s doctor says I can work?',
      answer: 'Insurance companies often use biased doctors to deny claims. You have the right to a second opinion. We work with independent medical experts who provide honest evaluations and testimony to counter insurance doctor opinions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I accept the insurance company\'s settlement offer?',
      answer: 'Never accept a settlement without legal review. Initial offers are typically far below fair value. We evaluate settlement offers, calculate true claim value, and negotiate maximum compensation including future medical needs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if my employer says I wasn\'t really hurt?',
      answer: 'Employer disputes don\'t determine claim validity. We gather medical records, witness statements, and expert testimony to prove your injury and its connection to work. Video evidence and accident reports often contradict employer claims.',
    },
