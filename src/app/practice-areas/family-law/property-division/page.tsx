      question: 'How is property divided in North Carolina vs Florida divorces?',
      answer: 'NC uses "equitable distribution" - fair but not necessarily equal. Courts start with 50/50 presumption but adjust based on factors like misconduct, contributions, economic circumstances. FL also uses equitable distribution with similar 50/50 starting point. Both states divide only marital property (acquired during marriage), not separate property (pre-marital, inherited, gifted). Wake and Mecklenburg Counties tend toward equal division absent compelling factors.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What counts as marital vs separate property?',
      answer: 'Marital property: Everything acquired during marriage regardless of title - homes, cars, retirement earned during marriage, businesses started, debts incurred. Separate property: Pre-marital assets, inheritances, gifts to one spouse, personal injury awards. Complications: commingling (mixing separate with marital), appreciation of separate property, improvements using marital funds. Tracing source of funds critical.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How are retirement accounts divided in divorce?',
      answer: 'Retirement earned during marriage is marital property. Division requires Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) for 401k/403b/pensions. Process: Calculate marital portion (time married/total service), value account, draft QDRO, plan administrator approval, court entry. Military retirement special rules. Social Security not divided but considered. NC and FL follow "time rule" formula. Mistakes can cost thousands - proper QDRO essential.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to the marital home in Raleigh, Charlotte, or Orlando divorces?',
      answer: 'Three main options: (1) Sell and split proceeds - most common, clean break. (2) One spouse keeps, buys out other\'s equity - requires refinancing to remove other from mortgage. (3) Continued co-ownership - rare, usually temporary for children\'s stability. Courts consider: children\'s needs, ability to maintain, mortgage qualification, other assets available. Wake County courts often order immediate sale in high-conflict cases.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is debt divided in divorce?',
      answer: 'Debts incurred during marriage are marital regardless of whose name. Courts allocate based on: who benefited, ability to pay, asset distribution, fault (in NC). Credit cards, mortgages, car loans, student loans all divided. Warning: Creditors not bound by divorce decree - if spouse doesn\'t pay joint debt, creditor can pursue you. Indemnification clauses and refinancing protect. Bankruptcy implications considered.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I protect my business from division in divorce?',
      answer: 'Depends on timing and structure. If started before marriage and kept separate - may be separate property but appreciation during marriage may be marital. If started during marriage - presumed marital. Protection strategies: prenuptial agreements (before marriage), buy-sell agreements, keeping spouse uninvolved, maintaining separate accounts. Valuation fights common. NC and FL courts can award business to operator spouse with buyout to other.',
