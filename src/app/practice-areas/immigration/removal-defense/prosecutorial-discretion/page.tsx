      question: 'What is prosecutorial discretion in immigration?',
      answer: 'ICE and DHS authority to decide whether to enforce immigration laws against specific individuals. Options include: not initiating removal proceedings, administrative closure of cases, deferred action (temporary protection), stays of removal, agreeing to relief, not appealing grants. Based on priorities: national security threats, serious criminals, recent border crossers are priorities. Long-term residents with equities, families, veterans are low priority. Not a legal status but practical protection.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who qualifies for prosecutorial discretion in 2025?',
      answer: 'Positive factors: long-term presence (10+ years), USC/LPR immediate family, primary caregiver for USC/LPR, serious medical conditions, elderly individuals, crime victims or witnesses, military service members/veterans, students and young adults, no criminal history, tax compliance. Negative factors: serious criminal convictions, recent illegal entry, immigration fraud, public safety concerns, gang membership, prior deportations. Balance of factors determines eligibility.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I request prosecutorial discretion?',
      answer: 'Multiple avenues: (1) Before filing - request ICE not initiate proceedings, (2) After NTA issued - request from OPLA trial attorney, (3) In court - joint motion for administrative closure or dismissal, (4) Post-order - request stay of removal from ICE, (5) Detained cases - request from ICE ERO. Include: cover letter explaining equities, supporting documentation, criminal history explanation if applicable, evidence of rehabilitation, community support letters. No official form but comprehensive package essential.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between administrative closure and dismissal?',
      answer: 'Administrative closure: case removed from active docket but not terminated, can be recalendared by either party, removal proceedings technically continue, no final order issued, allows time for other relief. Dismissal/Termination: ends removal proceedings completely, NTA terminated, must start new proceedings to deport, more permanent than closure, harder to obtain. Both require DHS agreement or judge\'s discretion. Closure more common when waiting for other petitions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can prosecutorial discretion lead to legal status?',
      answer: 'PD itself does not provide legal status - it\'s temporary forbearance from enforcement. However, it can: allow time to pursue other immigration benefits (family petitions, employment sponsorship), permit work authorization in some cases (deferred action), prevent accrual of unlawful presence, enable completion of education or military service, provide stability while legislation pending. Not a path to green card but can facilitate other paths. Subject to change with new administrations or policies.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if priorities change or discretion is revoked?',
      answer: 'Prosecutorial discretion can be revoked if: commit new crimes, become enforcement priority, administration policy changes, violate terms of discretion, new negative information emerges. If revoked: removal proceedings restart if administratively closed, deportation can proceed if stayed, work authorization terminated, must seek other relief quickly. Best practice: maintain clean record, comply with all requirements, have backup plan, monitor policy changes, consider pursuing permanent relief while protected.',

    introduction: `Not everyone in removal proceedings is an enforcement priority. Through prosecutorial discretion, ICE and DHS can choose to defer or decline enforcement against individuals who pose no threat and have strong ties to the United States. Our experienced immigration attorneys in Raleigh, Charlotte, Smithfield, and Orlando understand how to present compelling discretion requests that highlight positive equities, demonstrate community value, and align with current enforcement priorities. We work directly with ICE officials and government attorneys to secure administrative closure, deferred action, or case dismissal for deserving clients who should not be deported.`,
