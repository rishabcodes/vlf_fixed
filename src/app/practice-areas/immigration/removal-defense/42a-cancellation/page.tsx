    {
      question: 'What are the requirements for 42A cancellation of removal?',
      answer: 'Four main requirements: (1) Continuous physical presence in US for at least 10 years before NTA service date, (2) Good moral character during those 10 years, (3) No convictions for crimes listed in INA sections 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2), or 237(a)(3), (4) Removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to USC or LPR spouse, parent, or child. Cannot be for yourself. Judge has discretion even if all requirements met.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What qualifies as exceptional and extremely unusual hardship?',
      answer: 'Much higher standard than extreme hardship. Factors: qualifying relative has serious medical condition requiring your care, no adequate medical care in your country, disabled child needs your assistance, elderly parent depends on you, family never lived in your country and doesn\'t speak language, dangerous country conditions for family, complete financial dependence. Normal hardship of separation not enough. Need multiple strong factors.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the stop-time rule affect 42A cancellation?',
      answer: 'Physical presence stops accruing when: (1) Served with Notice to Appear (NTA), (2) Commit certain crimes, (3) Leave US for over 90 days in single trip or 180 days total. Clock stops permanently - cannot restart. Must have full 10 years before any stop-time trigger. Brief departures under 90 days usually OK if maintained residence. Calculate carefully from entry date to NTA service.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What crimes disqualify me from 42A cancellation?',
      answer: 'Permanent bars: aggravated felony, controlled substance offense (except single marijuana possession under 30g), two or more crimes of moral turpitude (not from single scheme), firearms offense, domestic violence/stalking/child abuse, false claim to US citizenship. Also: crimes involving moral turpitude within 5 years of entry with possible sentence 1+ years, prostitution, serious criminal per Attorney General. Review complete criminal history.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does 42A cancellation take in Immigration Court?',
      answer: 'Charlotte Immigration Court: 2-3 years to individual hearing. Atlanta (covering NC): 18-24 months. Orlando: 2-3 years. Factors affecting timeline: court backlog, continuances, evidence gathering needs, attorney availability. Master calendar: 2-4 appearances typical. Individual hearing: 2-4 hours usually. Decision: oral at hearing or written later. If denied, appeal adds 12-18 months.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work and travel while my 42A case is pending?',
      answer: 'Work authorization: Can apply for employment authorization document (EAD) while case pending if not detained. File I-765 with immigration court proceedings code (c)(8). Travel: Strongly discouraged - leaving US may trigger abandonment of application or affect continuous presence. Even with advance parole risky. Any departure over 90 days breaks continuity. Stay in US throughout proceedings.',

    introduction: `Facing removal proceedings doesn't mean deportation is inevitable. For non-permanent residents who have built their lives in the United States over many years, 42A cancellation of removal offers a path to lawful permanent residence. This form of relief rewards those who have established deep roots in American communities and whose removal would cause exceptional hardship to their U.S. citizen or permanent resident family members. Our experienced removal defense attorneys in Raleigh, Charlotte, Smithfield, and Orlando have successfully represented hundreds of clients in immigration court, proving the exceptional hardship standard and securing green cards for deserving families.`,
