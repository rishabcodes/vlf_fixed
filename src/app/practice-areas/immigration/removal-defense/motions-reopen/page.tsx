    {
      question: 'What are the deadlines for filing a motion to reopen?',
      answer: 'Generally must file within 90 days of final removal order. Exceptions: no deadline for changed country conditions in asylum cases, no deadline for in absentia orders if no notice received, no deadline for battered spouses (VAWA), no deadline if government agrees (joint motion). BIA has different rules: 90 days for most cases, 180 days for in absentia. Only one motion to reopen allowed unless exceptions apply. File immediately - courts strictly enforce deadlines.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What qualifies as new evidence for a motion to reopen?',
      answer: 'Evidence must be: (1) Material - would likely change outcome, (2) Previously unavailable - not just undiscovered, (3) Not available at time of hearing despite due diligence. Examples: new country condition reports showing increased danger, medical diagnosis not previously available, marriage certificate to USC/LPR after proceedings, birth of USC children, criminal case dismissal or vacatur, new precedent decisions changing law. Cannot be evidence you chose not to present or forgot about.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I prove ineffective assistance of counsel?',
      answer: 'Lozada requirements: (1) Affidavit detailing agreement with counsel, what counsel did/didn\'t do, how it prejudiced case, (2) Inform former counsel of allegations and provide opportunity to respond, (3) File bar complaint or explain why not filed. Must show counsel\'s performance fell below reasonable standards AND different outcome likely with competent counsel. Common grounds: missed deadlines, failure to submit evidence, incorrect legal advice, not showing up to hearings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I file multiple motions to reopen?',
      answer: 'Generally limited to ONE motion to reopen, but exceptions exist: (1) Changed country conditions for asylum - no numerical limit, (2) In absentia removal orders - can file based on lack of notice, (3) VAWA cases - special provisions, (4) Joint motions with government agreement, (5) Sua sponte reopening by court/BIA - no limit but rare. Strategic consideration: use your one motion wisely. Can sometimes file motion to reconsider separately if based on legal errors.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if my motion to reopen is granted?',
      answer: 'Case returns to previous posture: If Immigration Court grants - new hearing scheduled, can present new evidence/arguments, previous order vacated, may get bond hearing. If BIA grants - usually remands to Immigration Court, sometimes decides case itself, can order specific proceedings. Not a guarantee of different outcome - must still win underlying case. Stay of removal not automatic - must request separately. Can pursue original or new forms of relief.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a motion to reopen take to decide?',
      answer: 'Immigration Court: 3-6 months typically, expedited if detained. BIA: 6-12 months average, longer if complex. Emergency motions: can request expedited review for urgent circumstances. Factors affecting timing: court backlog, complexity of issues, need for response from DHS, whether briefing scheduled. During wait: removal order remains in effect unless stay granted, can be detained or removed, should request stay immediately.',
    },

    introduction: `A removal order doesn't have to be the final word. When new evidence emerges, circumstances change dramatically, or your previous attorney failed you, a motion to reopen can provide a second chance at relief. Our experienced immigration attorneys in Raleigh, Charlotte, Smithfield, and Orlando understand the strict requirements for reopening cases and work diligently to meet deadlines, compile compelling evidence, and present persuasive arguments to Immigration Judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Time is critical - most motions must be filed within 90 days, and courts rarely grant extensions.`,
