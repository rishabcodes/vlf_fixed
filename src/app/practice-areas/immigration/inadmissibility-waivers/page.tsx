      question: 'What is an inadmissibility waiver and when do I need one?',
      answer:
        'An inadmissibility waiver forgives certain grounds that would otherwise prevent you from entering or remaining in the US. You need one if USCIS or a consular officer determines you are inadmissible due to criminal, health, fraud, or other issues.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between I-601 and I-601A waivers?',
      answer:
        'I-601 waivers are filed after a finding of inadmissibility and can address multiple grounds. I-601A is a provisional waiver specifically for unlawful presence, filed before consular processing to avoid family separation.',

      question: 'What constitutes "extreme hardship" for waiver purposes?',

    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a waiver for any criminal conviction?',
      answer:
        'Not all crimes are waivable. Certain aggravated felonies and some drug trafficking offenses cannot be waived. We analyze your specific convictions to determine waiver eligibility and develop the strongest possible case.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the waiver process take?',
      answer:
        'Waiver processing times vary significantly, typically 12-24 months for I-601 waivers and 4-8 months for I-601A waivers. Complex cases requiring extensive documentation may take longer. We track all case timelines closely.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if my waiver is denied?',
      answer:
        'Waiver denials can often be appealed or overcome with additional evidence. We analyze denial reasons and develop strategies including appeals to AAO, motions to reopen, federal court challenges, or refiling with new evidence.',
