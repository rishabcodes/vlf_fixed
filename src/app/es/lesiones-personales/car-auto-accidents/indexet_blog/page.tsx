          <li><strong>Drunk Driving:</strong> Impaired drivers causing devastating crashes</li>
          <li><strong>Speeding:</strong> Excessive speed reducing reaction time and increasing impact severity</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Compensation Available</h3>
        
        <p>North Carolina law allows car accident victims to seek compensation for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medical Expenses:</strong> Current and future medical bills, rehabilitation, and therapy</li>
          <li><strong>Lost Wages:</strong> Income lost due to injury and reduced earning capacity</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>North Carolina's Contributory Negligence Law</h3>
        
        <p>North Carolina follows a strict contributory negligence rule, meaning if you're found even 1% at fault for the accident, you may be barred from recovering damages. This makes it crucial to have an experienced attorney who can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thoroughly investigate your accident</li>
          <li>Gather evidence proving the other driver's fault</li>
          <li>Counter any claims that you contributed to the accident</li>
          <li>Build a strong case for full compensation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Do After a Car Accident</h3>
        
        <p>The steps you take immediately after an accident can significantly impact your case:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Seek Medical Attention:</strong> Your health comes first, and medical records document your injuries</li>
          <li><strong>Call the Police:</strong> An official accident report provides crucial evidence</li>
          <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Take photos, get witness information, and keep all records</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Admit Fault:</strong> Even saying "I'm sorry" can be used against you</li>
          <li><strong>Contact an Abogado:</strong> Before speaking with insurance companies, get legal advice</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In North Carolina, you generally have three years from the date of the accident to file a personal injury lawsuit. However, certain circumstances can shorten this deadline. Don't wait - evidence can disappear, witnesses' memories fade, and your rights may be lost.</p>
