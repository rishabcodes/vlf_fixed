      question: 'What should I do immediately after being hit by a car as a pedestrian?',

    },
    {
      question: "Can I recover compensation if I wasn't in a crosswalk when hit?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you may still recover compensation even if you weren't in a crosswalk. While this complicates your case under NC's contributory negligence law, we can often prove the driver was still 100% at fault through distraction, speeding, or other negligence.",

    {
      question:
        "How does North Carolina's contributory negligence law affect pedestrian accidents?",
      answer:
        "NC's harsh contributory negligence law means if you're found even 1% at fault, you receive nothing. Insurance companies exploit this by claiming pedestrians were jaywalking, not paying attention, or wearing dark clothing. We fight these tactics aggressively.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if the driver who hit me doesn't have insurance?",
      answer:
        "You can file an uninsured motorist claim with your own insurance company. NC requires UM coverage, and we'll help you recover the maximum amount available under any applicable policies.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How much compensation can I receive for my pedestrian accident injuries?',
      answer:
        'Compensation depends on injury severity, medical costs, lost wages, and other factors. Pedestrian accidents often result in serious injuries, leading to significant settlements for medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering, and other damages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a pedestrian accident lawsuit in North Carolina?',
      answer:
        "North Carolina has a 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims. However, evidence disappears quickly in pedestrian accidents, so it's crucial to contact an attorney immediately after your accident.",
