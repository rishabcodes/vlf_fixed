      answer:
        'Report the injury to your supervisor immediately, seek medical attention (even for minor injuries), document everything with photos and written notes, get witness information, and contact an attorney before giving recorded statements. North Carolina requires reporting within 30 days, but do it immediately.',

      question: 'Can I see my own doctor for a workplace injury?',
      answer:
        'In North Carolina, your employer can direct your initial medical treatment. However, you may be able to change doctors after the initial visit. We help ensure you receive proper medical care from doctors who understand workplace injuries, not just company doctors.',

      question: 'What if my employer says the accident was my fault?',
      answer:

      question: 'What benefits am I entitled to after a workplace accident?',

    },
    {
      question: "Should I accept the insurance company's settlement offer?",
      answer:
        'Never accept a settlement without legal review. Initial offers are often far below fair value and may waive future medical rights. We evaluate offers, negotiate maximum settlements, and ensure your future medical needs are protected.',
