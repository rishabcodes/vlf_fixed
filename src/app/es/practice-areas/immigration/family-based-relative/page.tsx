      question: 'How long does family-based immigration take?',
      answer:
        'Processing times vary significantly. Immediate relatives (spouses, parents, unmarried children under 21 of U.S. citizens) have no waiting period and typically complete the process in 8-14 months. Family preference categories can take 2-20+ years depending on the relationship and country of birth.',

    {
      question: 'Can I work while my family petition is pending?',
      answer:
        "If you're in the U.S. and eligible to adjust status, you can apply for employment authorization (EAD) after filing Form I-485. Work permits are typically approved within 90 days.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What if my family member entered illegally?',
      answer:
        "Immediate relatives who entered without inspection may still adjust status if they're married to a U.S. citizen. Others may need to apply for waivers or consular process with an I-601A provisional waiver.",

    {
      question: 'Can I petition for my same-sex spouse?',

        'Yes, since 2013, same-sex marriages are fully recognized for immigration purposes. We help LGBTQ+ couples navigate the family immigration process with sensitivity and expertise.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What documents are needed for family petitions?',
      answer:
        'Essential documents include proof of relationship (marriage/birth certificates), proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residence, financial support documents (I-864), and supporting evidence of bona fide relationships.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can stepchildren immigrate through marriage?',
      answer:
        'Yes, stepchildren can immigrate if the marriage creating the relationship occurred before the child turned 18. The process is the same as for biological children.',
