      question: 'Who can file a wrongful death claim in North Carolina?',
      answer:
        "In NC, only the personal representative of the deceased's estate can file a wrongful death claim. This is typically the spouse, parent, or adult child. The compensation recovered is distributed to beneficiaries according to state law.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a wrongful death lawsuit?',
      answer:
        "North Carolina has a 2-year statute of limitations for wrongful death claims from the date of death. However, certain circumstances may extend this deadline. It's crucial to contact an attorney immediately to protect your rights.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What compensation can be recovered in a wrongful death case?',
      answer:
        'NC law allows recovery for the "pecuniary value" of the deceased\'s life to beneficiaries, including lost income, benefits, services, protection, care, and assistance. Medical expenses and funeral costs may also be recoverable.',
    },
    {
      question: "Can we file a wrongful death claim if there's also a criminal case?",
      answer:
        'Yes, criminal and civil cases are separate. A criminal conviction is not required for a successful wrongful death claim, and the burden of proof is lower in civil court (preponderance of evidence vs. beyond reasonable doubt).',

    {
      question: 'How much does it cost to hire a wrongful death attorney?',

    },
    {
      question: 'What if my loved one was partially at fault for the accident?',
      answer:
        'North Carolina follows contributory negligence law, which can bar recovery if the deceased was even partially at fault. However, we know how to investigate thoroughly and prove the defendant was 100% responsible for the death.',
