    description:
      'When a person from another country immigrates to the United States, their goal will usually be to receive a¬†Green Card, which will give them lawful permanent resident status. This will ensure that they can continue living in the country and earning an income, while also allowing them to travel freely and potentially even sponsor other family members for¬†immigration.
