While it is a big job creator, the agricultural industry is also among the¬†most dangerous¬†in terms of job-related injuries, given the physical nature of work and the numerous potential occupational hazards.

Chemicals: Certain chemicals such as herbicides or pesticides that are often used when working with crops can be harmful to someone who comes into contact with them, whether through inhalation, or contact with the skin, eyes, or mouth.
