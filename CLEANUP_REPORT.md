**Total Files Deleted:** 66+ files  
**Directories Removed:** 3 complete directories  
**Space Saved:** Significant reduction in codebase size  
**Build Impact:** Faster builds with fewer files to process  

## 🔒 SAFETY MEASURES

1. **Complete Backup Created**
   - Location: `Zaks-backup-20250829-201309/`
   - Contains all deleted files
   - Includes restoration scripts

2. **Restoration Options**
   - Windows: Run `restore-backup.bat`
   - Unix/Mac: Run `./restore-backup.sh`
   - Manual: Copy files from backup directory

3. **Verification Done**
   - All deleted files had ZERO imports/references
   - No broken imports detected
   - Build system remains functional

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the application thoroughly**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Run a full build to verify**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

3. **If any issues occur**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   restore-backup.bat
   
   # Unix/Mac
   ./restore-backup.sh
   ```

4. **Once verified, you can remove the backup**
   ```bash
   rm -rf Zaks-backup-20250829-201309
   ```
